            <p>Hi, my name is Victor. My friends would describe me as creative, curious and, hopefully, kind. 
              I enjoy being in environments that encourage me and try to encourage others.
              My formal education is in Aerospace Engineering, Automation and Control Engineering. 
              <br><br>  During my Bachelors i developed an interest in mathematical modelling and programming. 
              Like many inspired by the sucesses of machine learning and analogies to mathematical models of neuronal functioning in biology. 
              Furthermore, control theory attracted me as the study of dynamical systems, or, in more abstract terms,
               the study of input-output relationships, their stability properties and algorithms to guide outputs by adequate inputs. 
              <br><br> I was lucky to have had the opportunity to work on industrial robot systems, study controllers and develop 
              machine learning algorithms in the R&D company,  <a href="https://www.ipa.fraunhofer.de/en/expertise/robot-and-assistive-systems/assembly-automation/analysis-of-automation-potentials-in-assembly-processes.html" target="_blank">Fraunhofer IPA</a> . 
              I also worked with back-end software feature integration (at <a href="https://www.astos.de/" target="_blank">astos solutions</a>), generative machine learning models (at <a href="https://www.elem.bio/" target="_blank">elem biotech</a>) and (little) reinforcement learning (at <a href="https://www.imsb.uni-stuttgart.de/research/cbb/" target="_blank">IMSB Uni Stuttgart</a>).
              Furthermore, i am happy to have studied Aerospace Engineering since it provided a basis of physics and mathematics in an engineering context that is 
              very interesting by itself, but also useful in other fields (thinking about thermo-dynamics, fluid-dynamics, etc.).
              I also enjoyed the fact that the University in Stuttgart is quite industry oriented. <br>  <br> 
              Due to my multicultural upbringing i was sure that i wanted to leave Germany, either to France or to Italy. 
              My choice ended up being the University in Padova, which is among the most prestigious in Italy.
              It was a very interesting experience and increased my cultural sensitivity.
              To me the differences in the educational system between Germany and Italy were very noteworthy. 
              None is better than the other, but the methodology differs. 
              It seems to me as though German university is more industry focused, while the Italian education is more academy focused. 
              This might be reinforced by history, tradition and the different economic situations of the countries. 
              I might also be biased by my choice of studies.
              <br><br>
              My change of study to Automation and Control Engineering was inspired by mathematical modelling of biological systems 
              (back-propagation can be viewed as a model of long-term potentiation). I took some courses on systems biology and gene networks, 
              which turned out to be mainly about stability analysis of nonlinear functions representing protein networks. 
              In line with this interest in life sciences and mathematical computing, i managed to apply generative machine learning to 
              in-silico models of human hearts at a very innovative start-up called  <a href="https://www.elem.bio/" target="_blank">ELEM</a> bio-tech. 
              <a href="https://www.elem.bio/" target="_blank">ELEM</a> develops virtual models of hearts to enable a better understanding of ubiquitous heart diseases and treatments. 
              It was a much appreciated experience which sparked curiosity and created hope with regard to the impact technology can have on 
              humanity.
              <br><br> Currently I am in the process of finishing my Master's degree in Automation and Control Engineering, 
              with a focus on complex systems and machine learning. 
              <br><br>
              When i have enough time, i enjoy following my curiosities and read about topics that interest me.
              Such tend to be in the fields of biochemistry, computer science, machine learning and information theory.
              Differential geometry is also very fascinating.
              I did spend some time reading on Equivariant Convolutions, Density Functional Theory and Hartree-Fock methods, 
              ML-methods for the Schr√∂dinger wave equation, spherical harmonics, molecular simulations and bio-chemical property predictions.
              Also a tiny bit on the interesting fields of Cryptography and Computer System Security. 
              Apart from mathematical methods, i want to understand the systems which i use daily, such as telecommunications, 
              network routing and my computer. This involves established protocols, computer hardware and software + data architectures.
              Lately I have been interested in information geometry, wasserstein distances and optimal transport as well as 
              unifying my understanding of EM, VAEs, GPs and other algorithms. 
              <br><br>
              Since i am interested in more things than i have time for, i prefer working on challenging problems in a concrete setting.
              In the past i have worked in an application (or customer) oriented way, prioritizing usable results and bringing code to production. 
              With increasing knowledge i also enjoy more theoretical experiements in an in-silico setting (e.g. on toy datasets). 
              If you have work or research opportunities for me, please contact me.
              <br><br>
              Furthermore, i enjoy sports, like acrobatics, running, swimming and pretty much anything that gets me to move. I am very active physically.
              At work i care about the athmosphere and the people around me. I try to be a good team player and supporting to the whole organization. 
              A healthy work environment is paramount for health, productivity, creativity.
              <br><br>
              On this website I want to try to summarize some topics i consider interesting so i can look them up whenever needed.
              Maybe in a way that is also understandable to others. I will also include sources I found useful altough i might forget sometimes..
