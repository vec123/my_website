Graphs are mathematical structures that model pairwise relationships between objects. They are used in computer science to model networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, and more. Find here some algorithms .

## Betweeness centrality

a value that measures how important a node is in node-travsersals

## Cluster coefficient

counts the expected number of triangles (can be extended to the expected numer of a motif (here: motig=triangle)
