    <h1>Energy-Principles</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> With this post i want so summarize the variational formulation of mechanics and mathematical analysis that arises from it.
        Upon reading this blog-post, you should have an understanding of how the variational formulation of mechanics in terms 
        of a scalar function (the lagrangian, hamiltonian, or generating function) arise from (work) principles of newtonian mechanics.
        This formulation is the basis for Hamiltonian mechanics and the Hamilton-Jacobi theory.
        It is restricted to the fairly broad class of systems subject to forces, derivable from a single scalar function (monogenic forces).
        Examples of these forces are known as conservative forces, however, by an extenstion of the state-space also non-conservative
        forces and time-dependent energy-evolutions can be made monogenic. 
        The details and intricacies will become clearer in the following.
    </p>



    <h2>Newtons equation, virtual work and d'alemberts principle</h2>
    <p>We will assume that the reader is familiar with the famous equation of motion in newtonian mechanics</p>
    <div class="equation">
        $$
               F=ma = mv' = mr''
        $$
    </div>
    where /( F /) is the force, /( m /) is the mass of the particle and /( a = v'= r''/) is the acceleration ins /(3D/) position space.
    The equation of motion is a second order differential equation, which can be solved by specifying the initial conditions of the system.
    The solution is the trajectory of the particle in position space. 
    An important notion that arises is that of an equilibrium point, which is a point in position space
    where the force (and thus the acceleration) vanishes. Here, we consider a free particle, 
    i.e. a particle that is not subject to any constraints and can be moved in arbitrary directions. 
    Assume the particle were constrained to be located on a plane (e.g. a ball on a table). 
    We denote enforce the plane by the constraint /( f(r) = f(x,y,z) = 0 /).
    The ball is in equilibrium (no acceleration occurs) eventhough the force of gravity is acting on it. 
    This is because a reactive force is acting on the ball, which cancels out the force of gravity. 
    We have
    <div class="equation">
        $$
        F + R = ma
        $$
    </div>
    where /( R /) is the reactive force.
    Let us introduce the work-function 
    <div class="equation">
        $$
        \delta w =  F \delta r
        $$
    </div>,
    where /( \delta r /) is the virtual displacement of the particle. 
    It corresponds to any arbitrary variation of /( r /). The quantity /(dr/) is but a special type of variation.
    Thus, whenever /( \delta /) is used, the reader might replace it with /( d /) to obtain the special variation.
    The difference is that /( \delta /) represents any arbitrary variation not necessarily consistent with the actual motion, 
    wheras /( d /) is consistent. Intuitively speaking, the virtual displacement is a small displacement that is not necessarily real,
    and virtual work is the work done by the forces on this virtual displacement. 
    It does not necessarily correspond to the real work that is being done. 
    /( \d w /) is a the work performed by a system on a real infitesimal displacement /(dr/), 
    /(\delta w ) is a (virtual) work done by (imagined) infitesimal (virtual) displacement /( \delta r/). 
    Thus the variation is merely a generalization of an infinitesimal change. 
    Generally speaking, the real displacement is tied to a specific parameterization while the variational displacement is not.
    In equilibrium we have
    <div class="equation">
        $$
        \delta w = (F + R - ma) \delta r = 0 
        $$
   </div>
   We will consider that the reactive forces /(R/) are ideal, in the sense that they do not do any work /(R \delta r = 0 /).
   If we use the special variation /(dr/), this condition means that the reactive forces are orthogonal to parameterization /(f(r)/) of the plane.
   This assumption is the assumption of ideal reactive forces. 
   It holds for many systems, but fails for example for frictional forces, deformations non-holonomic (velcoity dependent) constraints, 
   contacts with slip-stick conditions and non-equilibrium systems. 
   Although, this might seem like a big restriction, the method remains very powerful and is used in many applications 
   (similar to how most mathematical models are friction-free and offer deep insight nontheless).  
   Under this assumption obtain the following equation of equilibrium
   <div class="equation">
    $$
    \delta w = (F - ma) \delta r = 0
    $$ 
   </div>,
   which is known as D'Alemberts principle. 
   This principle makes the remarkable statement that a system is in equilibrium if one adds the inertial forces to the impressed forces.
   We assume that the work done by the forces corresponds to a scalar function /(U = -V /), 
   so that  /(\delta w = - \delta V /)  and /(dw = - dV /) and /(F = \frac{dw}{dr} = - \nabla V /). 
   This is the definition of conservative forces. Conservative forces are derivable from a scalar function and thus monogenic.
   Under this assumption we can write the equation of motion as
   <div class="equation">
    $$
    \delta w = F\delta r - ma\delta r  = \delta V -  ma\delta r 
    $$
   </div>,
  Replacing /(\delta r /) by /(dr/), we obtain the equation of motion in terms of the lagrangian
  <div class="equation">
    $$
    dw =  d V +  madr = d V +  mavdt = d V - \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} mv^2 = d ( V+T ) = 0
    $$
   </div>
   , which is the well known theorem of energy conservation for conservative systems.
   From d'Alemberts principle we also obtain apparent forces in accelerated reference systems.
   

   <h3>Apparent Forces in accelerated reference systems</h3>

   <h2>D'Alembert to least constrain to Lagrangian</h2>
   D'Alemberts principle is a powerful tool to derive the equations of motion for a system. 
   However, it is not in the for of a definite integral.
   This form is 
   $$
   <div class="equation">
    I = \int F(y,y',x)dx
    $$
   </div>
  where /( F(y,y',x) /) is any function of three variables. 
  By the calculus of variation, one can solve analytically for the stationary value of this integral. 
  Also if /( F(y,y',y'',x) /) contains /( 4 /) variables including the second derivative. 
  However, for thevariational principles for mechanics we need not consider this case.
  The advantage of a formulation as stationary value of an integral lies in the analytical solution which can be obtained.
  D'Alemberts principle can be transformed into such a definite integral by integration with respect to time.
  Consider
  <div class="equation">
    $$
    \int \delta w dt = \int \sum_i (F_i - \frac{d}{dt}(m_iv_i) ) \delta r_i dt.
    $$
   </div>
   Considering the convervative nature of /(F/) we obtain
   <div class="equation">
    $$
    \int \sum_i F_i dt = \int - \delta V dt.
    $$
   </div>
   For the second term we obtain

   <div class="equation">
    $$
    \int \sum_i \frac{d}{dt}(m_iv_i) \delta r_i dt =  -[-m_iv_i \delta r_i]_{t_1}^{t_2} + \int m_i v_i \frac{d}{dt} \delta r_i dt 
    $$
    $$
    = -[-m_iv_i \delta r_i]_{t_1}^{t_2} +  \int m_i v_i \delta \frac{d}{dt} r_i dt
    $$
    $$
    = -[-m_iv_i \delta r_i]_{t_1}^{t_2} +  \int m_i v_i \delta v_i dt
    $$
    $$
    = -[-m_iv_i \delta r_i]_{t_1}^{t_2} +  \frac{1}{2} \int m_i \delta v_i v_i dt
    $$
    $$
    = -[-m_iv_i \delta r_i]_{t_1}^{t_2} +  \frac{1}{2} \delta \int m_i v_i^2 dt
    $$.
</div>
    Thus we obtain 
    <div class="equation">
        $$
        \int \delta w dt  = \int - \delta V dt  -[-m_iv_i \delta r_i]_{t_1}^{t_2} +  \frac{1}{2} \delta \int m_i v_i^2 dt
        $$
        $$
        = \delta \int T dt - \delta \int V dt - [-m_iv_i \delta r_i]_{t_1}^{t_2} = \delta \int T-V dt - [-m_iv_i \delta r_i]_{t_1}^{t_2}
        $$
        $$
        =  \delta \int L dt - [-m_iv_i \delta r_i]_{t_1}^{t_2}
        $$
   </div>
   If we vary between definite limits, the boundary term vanishes because at the limits the variation is zero.
   Now we can reformulate the principle of d'Alembert as the stationary value of a definite integral.
   <div class="equation">
    $$
    \delta w = (F - ma) \delta r = 0 
    $$
   </div>
   becomes
   <div class="equation">
    $$
    \int \delta w dt = \delta \int L dt =  \delta A = 0
    $$
   </div>
   where /( A /) is called the action functional. This is Hamiltions principle of least action. 
   Here we have assumed that the work done by the forces is derivable from a single scalar function. The impressed forces must be monogenic.
   If they are conservative, they are automatically monogenic, however, also non-conservative and time-dependant forces can be monogenic.
   For polygenic forces the transformation of d'alemberts principle into a definite integral is not possible.
   We have transformed the equilibrium condition into a stationary condition of a definite integral.
   The necessary and sufficient condition for the stationary value of a definite integral is the Euler-Lagrange equation:
   <div class="equation">
    $$
    \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = 0
    $$
   </div>.
   Advantages over D'Alemberts principle are that the equations of motion do not contain the accelerations, but only the velocities.
   The equations of motion are of first order in time, not second order and completely determined by a scalar function /(L/).
