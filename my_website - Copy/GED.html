                                                      On this page Systems of Symbols which operate by typographical rules are examined.
                                                      A very well known example of such a system is mathematical logic. In the following, a List of rules for Propositional Calculus will be formulated.
                                                      Futhermore, a short explanation of Gödel Numbering will be given on the example of a MIU-system.
                                                      Afterwards we will get to the core of the matter by examining TNT - Typographical Number Theory and outlining the general direction of Goedels proof.

                                                      It is a strenght of (mathematical) logic to take a statement which is common-sense and pack it into formal and meaningless symbolic operations.
                                                      <br>
                                                      Rule 1) gives a good example for that. The trivial and logical statement becomes apparent when one knows that  \( \land \) stands for "and" in mathematical notation.
                                                      However, the interpreted meaning of the symbol is not necessarily in the fore-ground of a logical examination. Often it can be better to regard the system as purely
                                                      typographical with a given set of manipulation rules and without interpreted meaning. A list of mathematical (typographical) rules is outlined in the following:
                                                      <br> <br>
                                                      Theorem rules:<br>
                                                      1) If \(x\) and \(y\) are theorems, then \(< x \land y >\) is a theorem. <br>
                                                      2) If  \(< x \land y >\) is a theorem, then both \(x\) and \(y\) are theorems. <br>
                                                      3) The string '~~' can be deleted from any theorem. It can also be inserted into any theorem, provided that the result is still well-formed. <br>
                                                      4) If \(y\) can be derived when \(x\) is assumed to be a theorem, then \(< x \subset y >\) is a theorem. <br>
                                                      5) Inside a fantasy (4) any theorem from the "reality" one level higher can be brought in and used. <br>
                                                      6) If \(x\) and \(< x \subset y >\) are both theorems, then \(y\) is a theorem. <br>
                                                      7) \(< x \supset y >\) and \(< ~x \subset ~y >\) are interchangeable. <br>
                                                      8) \(< ~x \land ~y >\) and \(~< x \lor y >\) are interchangeable. <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      Formation rules:<br>
                                                      If x and y are well formed, then the following strings are also well formed:<br>
                                                      1) \(~x\)<br>
                                                      2)\(< x \land y >\)<br>
                                                      3)\(< x \lor y >\)<br>
                                                      3)\(< x \subset y >\)<br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      Intented Interpretation of Symbols:<br>
                                                      \( \land \) - and<br>
                                                      ~ - not<br>
                                                      < ... > - groupers<br>
                                                      \( \lor \) - or
                                                      <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      It makes sense, when reading a theorem of Propositional Calculus to interpret anything but the atoms. For example the theorem \(< P \lor \text{~} P >\) is read as "P or not P".
                                                      Despite the fact that P is not a sentence it is easy to see that the resulting sentence will be true, no matter what is chosen for P.
                                                      The Power of Propositional Calculus is, that it gives a set of rules for producing statements which would be true in all conceivable worlds. Furthermore those statements can be produced
                                                      by a set of typographical rules

                                                      (2) Suppose you have Mx. Then Mxx is also an allowed string <br>
                                                      (3) You may replace III by U, however not U by III <br>
                                                      (4) If UU occurs within a string you may drop it <br>
                                                      <br>
                                                      From typographical to arithmetical:<br>

                                                      any number represented decimally, then this rule can be represented equally well by an arithmetical counterpart which involves
